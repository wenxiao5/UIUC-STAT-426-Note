## R Markdown

I'll revise the standard R Markdown introductory file a bit with some binomial distribution examples to help you get prepared for homework 1, which will essentially be practicing with R Markdown while exploring the poisson distribution.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r binomial}
# Find P(Y=3) when Y is binomial(10,.4)
dbinom(3,10,.4)
```
## Mathematical expressions

You can include latex mathematical expressions in the document quite easily.

For example $\int_{0}^{1} x^{2}dx=1/3$ or

$$
P(Y \leq 3)=\sum_{k=0}^{3}\frac{10!}{k!(10-k)!}.4^{k}.6^{10-k}
$$


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r density, echo=FALSE}
y=0:10
fy=dbinom(y,10,.4)
plot(y,fy, type='b')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Some binomial tests

Let's say we sample $Y$ from $binom(25,p)$ and want to find the p-value for testing $H_{0}$: $p=.5$ versus $H_{1}$: $p > .5$ . let $\hat{p}$ be the MLE of $p$ which equals $y/n$. 

We could do a few things. One would be the Wald test 

$$
t_{w}=\frac{\hat{p}-.5}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/25}}
$$
Then we could find the asymptotic p-value according to $P(Z > t_{w})$ where $Z \sim N(0,1)$.

Honestly though, there would be no particular reason to do that when we could find an exact P-value, which is to simply find the probability that a binomial random variable with $n=25$ and $p=.5$ is greater than or equal to $y$. Suppose $y=17$. Let's compare the p-values

```{r tests, echo=TRUE}

exact=1-pbinom(16,25,.5)
print(paste("exact p-value is ", as.character(exact)))
phat=17/25
tw=(phat-.5)/sqrt(phat*(1-phat)/25)
waldpval=1-pnorm(tw)
print(paste("wald p-value is ",as.character(waldpval)))
```
